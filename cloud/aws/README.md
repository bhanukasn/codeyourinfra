# AWS support

Since [release 1.5.0](https://github.com/esign-consulting/codeyourinfra/tree/1.5.0), the Codeyourinfra project provides AWS support. The same local virtualized environment required for Ansible playbooks' developing and testing then can run in the cloud. The local VirtualBox VMs can be replaced by EC2 instances, if you prefer. And it can be done as simply as executing the usual command `$ vagrant up`, from the **aws** directory of any project's solution.

The use of AWS requires one or more steps for making the environment ready to test the solution, though. Once the new EC2 instances always get new IP addresses, the Ansible inventory file must be dinamicaly generated right after their initialization. For that reason, each solution comes with a template of the Ansible inventory file (**ec2_hosts_template**) and a playbook responsible for obtaining the EC2 instances' IP addresses from AWS and generating the final inventory file based on the template (**playbook-ec2-instances-inventory.yml**). After the execution of `$ vagrant up`, just run the command `$ ansible-playbook playbook-ec2-instances-inventory.yml`, and the **ec2_hosts** file will be generated.
