# AWS support

Since [release 1.5.0](https://github.com/esign-consulting/codeyourinfra/tree/1.5.0), the Codeyourinfra project provides AWS support. The same local virtualized environment required for Ansible playbooks' developing and testing then can run in the cloud. The local VirtualBox VMs can be replaced by EC2 instances, if you prefer. And it can be done as simply as executing the usual command `$ vagrant up`, from the **aws** directory of any project's solution.
