The Codeyourinfra project aims to bring dev tools and practices to the ops world. The objective is to help sysadmins in gradually adopting tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), [GIT](https://git-scm.com) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io), and practices like coding, testing, versioning and deploying the infrastructure.

## Giving solutions

The project addresses sysadmins' common pain points, giving solutions that use such tools and practices. The solutions are all explained in detail at the [project website](http://codeyourinfra.today), and placed each one in a subdirectory of this repository. They are as follows:

* [Unarchive different remote files in different target servers](https://github.com/esign-consulting/codeyourinfra/tree/master/unarchive_from_url_param)
* [Same configuration file with different content in different environments](https://github.com/esign-consulting/codeyourinfra/tree/master/same_cfgfile_diff_content)
* [Check log files in a server through the web browser](https://github.com/esign-consulting/codeyourinfra/tree/master/check_server_log_files)
* [Get metrics for alerting in advance and preventing trouble](https://github.com/esign-consulting/codeyourinfra/tree/master/get_metrics_for_alerting)

## How to contribute
